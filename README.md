# Makeme
### An automated script that finishs up the boring things we do each time we start a project.
----
#### This projec is aimed for lazy people like me to do everything writing only 3 words.
it take cares of:
* making the initial directories
* writing a functional makefile for each directory
* writing an inital main.c That actually compiles

While also handlings some errors :D
